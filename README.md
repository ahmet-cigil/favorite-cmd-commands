# favorite-cmd-commands

My favorite 3 cmd commands are as follows:

## cat
It reads and prints files to an output.
My favorite commands is cat because I like cats!
 
## echo
It prints something to the screen.
I like this command since it echoes hat you type.
This was one of the commands I like first when I started with bash scripting.

## mkdir
I like how simple it is to make a directory without using the file manager or the mouse to wander around. Just cd command back and forth and mkdir command to do it!
